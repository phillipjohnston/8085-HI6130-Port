    2. ASSEMBLER

          XASM cross assemblers read a source file  (.ASM),  and  produce  a
       code file (.HEX) containing either MOTOROLA or INTEL format ASCII-HEX
       download  records.  A  optional  listing  file  (.LST)  may  also  be
       produced.

       2.1 Using the assemblers

             An assembler is invoked by entering its  name  at  the  command
          prompt, in the following format:

                           ASMxx <filename> [options]

             The <filename> operand is the name of the file to be assembled,
          it is assumed to have the extension ".ASM" if none is supplied.

             Unless otherwise specified,  the code produced by the assembler
          is written to a file  with  the  name  '<filename>.HEX',  and  the
          listing is written to a file with the name '<filename>.LST'.

          2.1.1 Command line options

                The following options may be specified on the command  line,
             following the <filename> operand:

             -A - [A]lternate jumps/calls (51,320,AVR)

                     Causes  8051  family  assemblers  to   use   AJMP/ACALL
                  instructions in place of LJMP/LCALL.

                     Causes the AVR assembler to use RJMP/RCALL in place  of
                  JMP/CALL when an explicit page number is not supplied.

             -C - [C]ase sensitive

                     Causes the assembler  to  make  a  distinction  between
                  upper and lower case characters in symbol names.  If  this
                  option  is  not  used,  the  assembler  will  ignore  case
                  differences,  and assume that the symbols  are  the  same.
                  NOTE: When using this option,  you must enter any register
                  names in UPPER case.

             C=<filename> - Specify [C]ode file

                     This option allows you to specify the file to which the
                  output code is written.  If no extension  is  supplied  as
                  part of <filename>, it defaults to ".HEX".

             -F - Generate [F]ull listing

                     Causes the assembler to output a full source listing to
                  the '.LST' file.  By default, only lines containing errors
                  are written to the listing file.
    XASM Cross Assemblers                                            Page: 3


             -I - Generate [I]ntel format HEX file

                     Causes the assembler to output the code to  the  '.HEX'
                  file in INTEL hex format.  By default the code is  written
                  to the file in MOTOROLA hex format.

             L=<filename> - Specify [L]isting file

                     This option allows you to specify the file to which the
                  listing is written. If no extension is supplied as part of
                  <filename>, it defaults to ".LST".

             O=<value> - [O]ptimization (00,01,02,05,08,09,11,12,16,96)

                     This option allows you to set a limit  to  the  maximum
                  number of optimization passes  which  the  assembler  will
                  perform while attempting to minimize code size and resolve
                  forward  referenced  symbols.  If  a  symbol  can  not  be
                  resolved within  this  many  passes,  the  assembler  will
                  terminate with an error message.

                     You may specify between 0 and 127  optimization  passes
                  to be run,  with 0  being  a  special  case  in  which  no
                  optimization  is  performed.  Without  optimization,   all
                  non-specified memory references  and  offsets  default  to
                  their largest form, and forward references in EQU, ORG, or
                  RMB statements will not work.  The code generated will not
                  be optimal, but assembly time is reduced.  This feature is
                  most  useful  when  initially  testing  and  debugging   a
                  program.

                     The default maximum number of optimization passes is 3.

                  NOTE:  The assemblers which do not support the 'O=' option
                  do not permit forward references in EQU, ORG or RMB.

             P=<length> - Set page length

                     This option specifies the number of lines which will be
                  printed on each page. The default number of lines per page
                  is 60.

             -Q - [Q]uiet mode

                     Causes  the  assembler  to  be  quiet,  inhibiting  the
                  display of the progress messages.

             -S - Generate [S]ymbol table

                     Causes the assembler to sort  and  display  the  symbol
                  table at the end of the  listing  file.  By  default,  the
                  symbol table is not displayed.

             -T - Output to [T]erminal

                     Causes the assembler  to  output  the  listing  to  the
                  terminal, (via stdout) instead of the usual '.LST' file.
    XASM Cross Assemblers                                            Page: 4


             -W - Wrap relative addresses (AVR)

                     Causes the AVR assembler to allow RJMP/RCALL to "wrap",
                  making the entire 1st 8K  available.  This  option  should
                  only be used with CPU's that perform  this  wrapping  (ie:
                  those with only 8K  of  code  memory,  and  which  do  not
                  support JMP/CALL).

             W=<width> - Set page width

                     This option control the number of columns which will be
                  used for the printing of page titles and the symbol  table
                  listing. Default page width is 80 columns.

        -X - Translate eXternal reads (51,320)

                Causes 8051 family assemblers to translate  all  occurrences
             of "MOVX A,[DPTR]"  into "CLR A / MOVC A,[A+DPTR]",  for use in
             systems with simplified memory decoding logic.

       2.2 Redirecting the listing file

             When the listing file is directed to the terminal with the '-t'
          option on the command line,  it is displayed through the  standard
          output file,  allowing it to be redirected to a printer  etc.  via
          the shell  '>'  redirection operator  (EG:  ASMxx filename  -f  -t
          >LPT1:).  The progress messages  ('First pass...' etc)  are output
          through stderr,  and will therefore not  be  redirected  with  the
          listing.  NOTE that the listing may be more efficiently redirected
          with the 'L=' option.

       2.3 Source file format

          NOTE:  All XASM assemblers follow  a  consistent  generic  syntax,
          which is as close as possible to that published by the majority of
          CPU makers.  In a few cases,  this differs  significantly  from  a
          unique syntax published for a specific CPU or vendor.  Please read
          this section carefully,  and refer  to  the  EXAMPLE  PROGRAMS  to
          become familiar with the XASM syntax.

             The assembly source input lines are in the following format:

             '<label>[:]  <instruction>  <operands>  [;]<comment>'

             Labels must begin in column one, and must be separated from the
          instruction field by at least one blank or tab  character.  Labels
          may be followed by a ':' if desired,  however this is not required
          by the assembler.

             The instruction field must be indented by at least one space or
          tab (ie: the instruction name cannot begin in column 1).

             If the an instruction or directive requires operands,  then the
          operand field is required,  and is separated from the  instruction
          by at least one blank or tab.

             The optional comment field is delimited from the operand  field
          by at least one blank or tab,  and is ignored  by  the  assembler.
          Blanks or tabs within  the  operand  field  are  allowed  only  if
          contained within the delimiters of a character  string,  otherwise
          they will be interpreted as the end of the operand field.

             The asm48/H8/P5X/ST7/Z80/Z8 assemblers require  a  leading  ';'
          comment delimiter on all  line  comments.  These  assemblers  also
          permit blanks within the operand field.

             Any lines beginning with a '*'  or ';'  character in column one
          are considered to be  comments,  and  are  not  processed  by  the
          assembler.

       2.4 Expressions

             When an 8 or 16 bit value is  required  as  an  operand  to  an
          assembler directive or an instruction,  either a simple value,  or
          an expression consisting of simple values  and  operators  may  be
          used.

             All expressions are evaluated using  16  bit  values.  When  an
          expression is evaluated in an instruction requiring an  eight  bit
          value,  the lower eight bits are used.  Expressions are  evaluated
          from left to right,  as  each  operator  is  encountered,  without
          precedence.  Precedence can be forced with the  use  of  brackets.
          Spaces or tabs are not allowed within an expression,  unless  they
          are contained within a character string.

             The following operators may be used in an expression:

       2.4.1 Unary (one operand) operators:

               -   - Negation, returns the negative of the next value.
               ~   - Complement, returns ones complement of the value.
               =   - Swaps the high and low bytes of the next value.

       2.4.2 Binary (two operand) operators:

               +   - Addition.
               -   - Subtraction.
               *   - Multiplication.
               /   - Division (unsigned).
               \   - Modulus, returns remainder after division.
               &   - Bitwise AND.
               |   - Bitwise OR.
               ^   - Bitwise EXCLUSIVE OR.
               <   - Shift left
               >   - Shift right


       2.4.3 Values in expressions

               The following forms of simple values may be used.

               nnn     - Decimal number, eg: 21
               nnnD    - "" "": 21d
               nnnT    - "" "": 21t
               $nnn    - Hexadecimal number, eg: $15

       2.5 Addressing Modes

             XASM  assemblers  support  all  addressing  modes   for   their
          respective processors and will determine the type of addressing to
          use from the instruction and/or its operands.

             For cases  where  different  compatible  addressing  modes  are
          available, assemblers having optimization (O= option) will use the
          smallest (most efficient) form of unless optimization is disabled.
          Assemblers without optimization will use the largest  form  unless
          specifically instructed to use a smaller form.

          2.5.1 Immediate addressing

                For all assemblers except ASM85,  the operand is  determined
             to be an immediate value if it is  preceded  by  a  pound  sign
             ('#').  For instructions requiring only  8  bits  of  immediate
             data,  the lower eight bits of the  value  will  be  used.  The
             higher 8 bits of a value can be accessed by preceding  it  with
             '=' (swapping high and low bytes).

                The  '#'  character is NOT used  with  immediate  values  in
             ASM85,  because the immediate addressing context is inherent in
             the instruction.

          2.5.2 Direct/Extended addressing

                For assemblers supporting direct addressing (00, 01, 02, 05,
             08, 09 11, 12,  H8 and ST7),  the operand is determined to be a
             DIRECT  (8 bit)  address if it is  preceded  by  a  left  angle
             bracket ('<').  For most assemblers, this references the "zero"
             page of memory ($0000-$00FF).

                Assemblers having optimization (O= option)  allow an address
             to be forced to a ABSOLUTE or EXTENDED reference  by  preceding
             it  with  a  right  angle  bracket  ('>').  Assemblers  without
             optimization will always use this  form  of  addressing  unless
             direct addressing has been specified (with '<').

          2.5.3 Indirect addressing

                For processors supporting indirection  of  other  addressing
             modes, this is indicated by placing the addressing reference in
             square braces  ('[]').  Additionally,  ASM51 family  assemblers
             support the 8051 notation of a leading '@'.

          2.5.4 ASM11/12 use of ';'

                The 68HC11 and 68HC12 instruction  sets  have  an  ambiguity
             with regard to the use of ',' in certain instructions. This has
             to do with the fact that  ','  can be used to indicate indirect
             addressing from a register  (with offset),  and is also used to
             separate operands to some instructions.

                To resolve this issue,  the assemblers allow the use of  ';'
             in the following cases:

                For the BCLR,  BSET,  BRCLR and BRSET instructions,  the bit
             mask is separated from the address by a ';':

                    eg:     BCLR    MEMLOC;$01
                            BSET    1,X;$02
                            BRCLR   MEMLOC;$01,LABEL
                            BRSET   2,Y;$02,LABEL

                For ASM12's MOV, CALL, DBxx, IBxx and TBxx instructions, ';'
             is used to separate the operands:

                            MOV     #10;MEMLOC
                            MOV     1,X;2,Y
                            CALL    LABEL;1
                            CALL    1,X;2
                            DBEQ    A;LABEL

       2.6 Assembler directives

             The following directives (pseudo instructions) are supported by
          all of the assemblers:

          <label> EQU <expression>

             This directive sets the label on it's line to have the value of
          the operand expression.

          ORG <expression>

             This directive sets the internal program counter to  the  value
          of the operand expression,  such  that  subsequent  code  will  be
          generated at that address.

          TITLE <string value>

             This directive sets the title of the program to the text on the
          remainder of the line.  The title is displayed at the top of  each
          page in the listing, and by default is set to the name of the file
          being assembled.  Lines containing this directive will not  appear
          in the listing.

          PAGE

             This directive forces  a  page  eject  in  the  listing.  Lines
          containing this directive will not appear in the listing.

          SPACE

             This directive causes a blank line to appear  in  the  listing.
          Lines containing this directive will not appear in the listing.

          NOLIST

             This directive turns off the  source  listing,  preventing  any
          further lines from being displayed,  until  a  LIST  directive  in
          encountered.  NOLIST and LIST may be nested,  listing  is  resumed
          only when all levels of NOLIST have  been  turned  off.  Lines  in
          which errors occur are listed regardless of the NOLIST directive.

          LIST

             Re-enables output listing, following a NOLIST directive.

          LINE <expression>

             resets the assemblers internal line counter  to  the  specified
          value.  Lines containing this directive will  not  appear  in  the
          listing.

          END

             Causes  the  assembler  to  stop  processing,  and  ignore  the
          remainder of the source file.  Note that an END directive  is  NOT
          required.

          DB <expr1>[,<expr2>,<expr3>,...]
          FCB <expr1>[,<expr2>,<expr3>,...]

             These directives code the values  of  the  operand  expressions
          into memory as single byte constants.

          DW <expr1>[,<expr2>,<expr3>,...]
          FDB <expr1>[,<expr2>,<expr3>,...]

             These directives code the values  of  the  operand  expressions
          into memory as double byte constants.

          DRW <expr1>[,<expr2>,<expr3>,...]
          RDB <expr1>[,<expr2>,<expr2>,...]

             These directives are similar to DW/FDB,  except that  the  high
          and low bytes of the coded values are exchanged.

          DS <expression>
          RMB <expression>

             These directives reserve a number of bytes of memory  equal  to
          the value of the operand expression.  The contents of the reserved
          storage is undefined.

          STR 'text string'
          FCC 'text string'

             These directive code the  string  into  memory  as  ASCII  byte
          values.  The string may be delimited by any character which is not
          part of the string text.

          STRH 'text string'
          FCCH 'text string'

             These directives perform exactly  as  the  STR/FCC  directives,
          except that the high bit is set  on  the  last  character  in  the
          string.

          STRZ 'text string'
          FCCZ 'text string'

             These directives perform exactly  as  the  STR/FCC  directives,
          except that the string has a zero byte ($00) appended.

          2.6.1 Directives supported by ASM09 only

             SETDP <expression>

                This  directive  sets  ASM09's  default  direct  page   (DP)
             register to the eight bit value  of  <expression>.  Whenever  a
             reference is made to a memory location by  address,  without  a
             specific addressing mode,  the assembler will use  direct  page
             addressing if the high byte of the memory address  matches  the
             default DP register, otherwise extended addressing is used.  It
             is the responsibility of the  programmer  to  insure  that  the
             6809's DP register will contain the proper high  address  value
             during memory references subsequent to a 'SETDP' directive. The
             default DP register can be disabled by setting it  to  a  value
             greater than 255  (or less than 0),  which causes the assembler
             to always use extended addressing  (this is the default at  the
             beginning of an assembly).  NOTE:  To access the high byte of a
             symbol, use: SETDP 255&=SYMBOL

          2.6.2 Directives supported by ASM16 & ASMAVR only

             CPAGE <expression>

                This directive sets the default code page that is assumed by
             JMP and JSR/CALL instructions that do not contain  an  explicit
             code page.

          2.6.3 Directives supported by ASM51 & ASM320 only:

             <label> BIT <expression> (51, 320 only)

                Similar to  "EQU",  except that the label is forced to  have
             the "bit" type, regardless of the type of expression used.

             <label> DATA <expression> (51, 320 only)

                Similar to  "EQU",  except that the label is forced to  have
             the "direct non-bit" type, regardless of the type of expression
             used.

       2.7 Error Messages

             When the assembler detects an error  in  the  source  code,  it
          displays a message indicating a possible cause of  the  error,  in
          the source listing on the  line  immediately  following  the  line
          containing the error.  Errors which are encountered in  the  first
          pass,  are displayed at the top of the  listing,  along  with  the
          number of the line in which the error was detected.

             Forward  references  in  any  of  the  (EQU,  ORG,  or  RMB/DS)
          directives are not allowed,  and will cause an  'Undefined symbol'
          error in the first pass only, displayed at the top of the listing.

       2.8 Error message summary

          2.8.1 Duplicate symbol: <symbol name>

             The indicated symbol is defined  more  that  once  within  this
             assembly.

          2.8.2 Symbol table overflow.

             There are too many symbols  (labels)  in the program,  and  the
             assemblers symbol table has become full.

          2.8.3 Unable to resolve: <symbol name>

             The assembler is unable to determine a consistent value for the
             indicated symbol.  This is most likely due to excessive forward
             referencing, or a self referencing loop.

          2.8.4 Unknown instruction

             The instruction field on the indicated line does not contain  a
             valid instruction or assembler directive.

          2.8.5 Undefined symbol

             A symbol referenced  in  the  indicated  line  is  not  defined
             anywhere within this assembly, and has no value.

          2.8.6 Out of range

             The operand is not the range of values which can be  used  with
             the instruction.  eg:  A short branch to an  address  which  is
             further than +127 or -128 bytes from the program counter.

          2.8.7 Invalid addressing mode

             The addressing mode indicated  by  the  operand  field  of  the
             indicated line does not apply to the instruction on that line.

          2.8.8 Invalid register specification

             The instruction on the  indicated  line  specifies  a  register
             which is not a recognized register,  or cannot be used  in  the
             context specified by the instruction.

          2.8.9 Invalid expression syntax

             The expression on the indicated line contains a character which
             is not recognized as a valid operator.

          2.8.10 Invalid argument format

             The indicated line has an operand which is not in proper format
             for the instruction.

          2.8.11 Improperly delimited string

             A character string constant on the indicated line does not have
             a proper closing delimiter.  This is normally the single  quote
             character, but may be another character in conjunction with the
             FCC, FCCH, FCCZ, STR, STRH or STRZ directives.

          2.8.12 Improper alignment

             The instruction on this line either references,  or resides  at
             an odd location, when an even location is required.

       2.9 Additional notes on ASM86

             The 8086 assembly language was the most difficult to  adapt  to
          the  generic  syntax  used  throughout  the   XASM   package.   To
          accommodate doing this, a few extensions and changes were made:

             The RETF instruction is unique in that its operand is optional,
          and thus you must use  ';'  to indicate any comment following RETF
          without operands. No special comment delimiter is required for any
          other instruction.

             Symbols are used only to reference addresses, no information is
          recorded as to the size  of  the  symbol.  At  least  one  of  the
          operands to an instruction must contain an explicit size  (8 or 16
          bits). The assembler knows the the size of the registers, and thus
          any instructions involving registers will  automatically  use  the
          correct size.  For instructions which do not reference  registers,
          you can force one of the arguments to be recognized as an 8 or  16
          bit value by using the '<' or '>' character as a prefix:

                MOV     AL,DATA     Moves 8 bits
                MOV     AX,DATA     Moves 16 bits
                MOV     DATA,#12    ERROR: "Size not known"
                MOV     <DATA,#12   Moves 8 bits
                MOV     DATA,#<12   Equivalent to above
                MOV     >DATA,#12   Moves 16 bits
                MOV     DATA,#>12   Equivalent to above
                MOV     <DATA,#>12  ERROR: "Incompatible sizes"

             The '>'  and '<'  prefixes also have special meaning in JMP and
          CALL instructions:

                JMP     label       NEAR 16 bit RELATIVE jump
                JMP     <label      NEAR 8 bit RELATIVE jump
                JMP     >LABEL      NEAR INDIRECT jump through LABEL
                JMP     BX          NEAR Jump to address in BX
                JMP     [BX]        NEAR INDIRECT Jump through BX
                JMP     SEG:LABEL   FAR DIRECT jump
                JMP     SEG:>LABEL  FAR INDIRECT jump *
                JMP     SEG:[BX]    FAR INDIRECT jump *
            * In the last two examples, the SEG value is ignored, and
              the SEGMENT:OFFSET is taken from the operand address.

             Offsets  to  indirect  accesses  are  specified  by  placing  a
          constant value immediately before the opening  '['.  When  both  a
          BASE and an INDEX register are involved, use '+' to indicate them:

                MOV     AX,[BX]     Indirect through BX, no offset
                MOV     AX,[SI]     Indirect through SI, no offset
                MOV     AX,10[DI]   Indirect to DI with 10 byte offset
                MOV     AX,[BP+SI]  Indirect through BP+SI, no offset
                MOV     AX,5[BP+SI] Indirect thought BP+SI, 5 byte offset
                MOV     AX,[BX+10]  This MASM syntax NOT supported!!!

             The REPEAT and LOCK prefixes are implemented  as  instructions,
          which must precede the target instruction on a separate line.

    3. MACRO PREPROCESSOR

          MACRO is an assembly  source  code  pre-processor  which  provides
       macro substitution and conditional assembly facilities at the  source
       code level to virtually any assembler or cross assembler.

          MACRO reads the raw  assembler  source  from  one  or  more  files
       specified as its arguments,  and the processed assembler source  file
       is written to standard output where  it  can  be  redirected  into  a
       temporary file for later assembly.  All files specified as  arguments
       are effectively  concatenated  into  the  output  file  as  they  are
       processed,  providing a convenient way of  maintaining  large  single
       source programs as more manageable separate files.

          MACRO provides two types of macro definitions,  substitution,  and
       instruction.

       3.1 Substitution macros

             Substitution macros may be used  anywhere  in  any  non-comment
          line of the source file  (lines not beginning with '*'),  and when
          encountered,  are simply replaced by the  text  specified  in  the
          macro definition.

             Substitution macros are defined using the 'SET'  directive.  If
          the macro definition text contains spaces,  tabs,  or  commas,  it
          must be enclosed in double quotes.

             The following are examples of substitution macro definitions:

             sub1 set this_gets_substituted
             sub2 set "this gets substituted"

             Substitution macros are only recognized of they are  surrounded
          by non-alphanumeric characters.  This prevents substitutions  from
          occurring within other words which may  contain  the  pattern.  It
          does however require the restriction that the macro names  contain
          only alphanumeric characters.

          3.1.1 Command line substitutions

                Substitution macros may also be defined on the command  line
             with arguments of the form "<symbol>=<string>".

          eg: macro source_file1 source_file2 mode=debug >output_file

       3.2 Instruction macros

             Instruction macros may only be used in the instruction field of
          the source file, and when encountered, are replaced by one or more
          lines of assembly source code.

             Instruction macros may be passed operands in the operand  field
          of the assembly source  code.  If  multiple  operands  are  to  be
          passed, they should be separated from one another by commas.  If a
          single operand must contain spaces, tabs, or commas,  it should be
          enclosed in double quotes.

          3.2.1 Backslash commands

                The backslash character  '\'  has special meaning within  an
             instruction macro definition as follows:

        \n  - Substitute the <n>'th parameter from  the  macro  invocation
              line. <n> may range from zero to  nine,  parameter  zero  is
              considered to be the LABEL from that line, actual parameters
              from the operand field begin with parameter one.

        \#  - Substitute the number of parameters passed.

        \$  - Substitute a unique number which the total number  of  macro
              invocations to occur in this assembly so far. This is  often
              used to create unique labels within the macro.

        \.  - Substitute the current source file line number.

        \@n - Substitute a portion of the current date based on the digit
              'n', as follows:

              \@1 - Day of month, 1 or 2 digits.
              \@2 - Day of month, 2 digits.
              \@3 - Month of year, 2 digits.
              \@4 - Month of year in string form.
              \@5 - Month of year in three character string form.
              \@6 - Current year, 2 digits.
              \@7 - Current hour, 2 digits.
              \@8 - Current minute, 2 digits.
              \@9 - Current second, 2 digits.

        NOTE: The time is recorded when MACRO is first invoked.

        \\  - Place a backslash character in the macro definition.

                Instruction macros are defined with the MACRO directive, and
             are ended with the ENDMAC directive.

          3.2.2 Example instruction macro

                The following is an example  of  a  instruction  type  macro
             using 6809 assembly language:

            * MACRO TO PRINT A CHARACTER STRING
            PRINT   MACRO
            \0      PSHS    A,X         SAVE REGISTERS
                    LDX     #LAB2\$     STRING TO PRINT
             LAB1\$ LDA     ,X+         GET CHAR FROM STRING
                    BEQ     LAB3\$      END, QUIT
                    JSR     PRINTCHR    DISPLAY THE CHARACTER
                    BRA     LAB1\$      GO BACK FOR NEXT
             LAB2\$ FCCZ    "\1"        STRING TO PRINT
             LAB3\$ PULS    A,X         RESTORE REGISTERS
                    ENDMAC

       3.3 Macro directives

             MACRO supports the following directives, which may be placed in
          the instruction field of an assembler source file.  Note that only
          substitution type macros may be used  as  values  in  operands  to
          MACRO directives,  as MACRO has no knowledge  of  the  labels  and
          symbols used by the assembler.

             <name> SET <string>

                The SET defines the substitution type macro  with  the  name
             specified by  <name>  to have the text specified  by  <string>.
             Double quotes may be used  if  <string>  is  to  contain  tabs,
             spaces,  or commas.  If the macro being defined already exists,
             it is redefined with the new  value.  <name>  should  begin  in
             column one.

             <name> ESET <format>,<expression>

                The ESET directive sets a symbol to the numeric value of  an
             expression,  as processed through a format string.  The content
             of the format string is copied to the symbol,  with  the  value
             substituted where one of these special sequences is found:

                %u      - Unsigned value of expression
                %d      - Signed value of expression
                %x      - Hexadecimal value of expression
                %o      - Octal value of expression
                %b      - Binary value of expression
                %c      - ASCII character value of expression
                %%      - A '%' sign

                A width value may be specified  between  the  '%',  and  the
             output type denoted above,  in which case the  number  will  be
             output right justified in a field padded  with  spaces  to  the
             defined width.  If the number contains a leading '0', the field
             will be padded with '0's.  If the number if negative, the field
             will be left justified.

            Examples:
                A SET 10
                B SET 1
                C ESET %x,A+B           ; 'B'  (11 in HEX)
                C ESET %3u,A+B          ; ' 11'
                C ESET %03u,A+B         ; '011'
                C ESET %-3u,A+B         ; '11 '

             <name> MACRO

                The MACRO directive begins the definition of  a  instruction
             type macro.  All subsequent lines up to a ENDMAC directive  are
             included in the macro definition.  These lines are not  written
             to the output file.

             ENDMAC

                This  directive  terminates  an   instruction   type   macro
             definition.

             IF <expression>

                The IF directive causes MACRO  to  process  and  output  all
             subsequent lines up to an ELSE of ENDIF directive,  only of the
             result of the expression is non-zero.

             IFEQ <string>,<string>

                The IFEQ directive causes MACRO to process  and  output  all
             subsequent lines up to an ELSE or ENDIF directive,  only if the
             two argument strings match.

             IFNE <string>,<string>

                The IFNE directive causes MACRO to process  and  output  all
             subsequent lines up to an ELSE or ENDIF directive only  if  the
             two argument strings do not match.

             ELSE

                The ELSE directive causes MACRO to process  and  output  all
             subsequent lines up to an ENDIF directive only of the preceding
             IFEQ or IFNE directive failed.

             ENDIF

                This directive marks the end of  a  section  of  conditional
             assembly statements following a IFEQ, IFNE, or ELSE directive.

             INCLUDE "<filename>"

                The contents of the  specified  file  are  included  in  the
             output file at the point where the  INCLUDE  directive  occurs.
             Macro processing is performed on the included file.
    XASM Cross Assemblers                                            Page: 20


             ABORT "<text>"

                Causes MACRO  to  terminate,  displaying  an  error  message
             containing the specified text.

             PREFIX <char>

                Sets a prefix character which must be applied to  any  MACRO
             directive in order  for  it  to  be  recognized.  For  example:
             "PREFIX %"  causes MACRO to only recognize it's directives when
             '%' is prepended. (ie: "SET" becomes "%SET").  This can be used
             to  avoid  conflicts  with  processors  instructions  in   some
             assemblers. Also note that the prefix can be set on the command
             line with a "-P<char>" syntax.

                   eg: macro source_file(s) -P% >output_file

          3.3.1 Expressions

                The  numeric  expressions  accepted  for  the  IF  and  ESET
             directives consist of values and operators.  The values may  be
             of any of these forms:

                n, nT, nD   - Decimal number
                $n, nH      - Hexadecimal number
                @n, nO, nQ  - Octal number
                %n, nB      - Binary number
                'cc'        - ASCII character(s)

             The following operators are supported:

                +   - Addition
                -   - Subtraction and unary negation
                *   - Multiplication
                /   - Division
                %   - Modulus (remainder)
                &   - Bitwise AND
                &&  - Logical AND
                |   - Bitwise OR
                ||  - Logical OR
                ^   - Bitwise exclusive OR
                >   - Test for greater than (True=1, False=0)
                >=  - Test for greater than or equal to
                >>  - Shift right
                <   - Test for less than
                <=  - Test for less than or equal to
                <<  - Shift left 
                ==  - Test for equal to
                !=  - Test for NOT equal to
                !   - Unary logical NOT
                ~   - Unary bitwise compliment

                There are no precedence rules. Operations are performed left
             to right,  in the order that they they are encountered  in  the
             expression.  Brackets () can be used to force a different order
             of evaluation.

       3.4 Source File Synchronization

             MACRO removes it's own commands,  and adds macro expansions  to
          the source file as it is processed. A result of this is that lines
          in the output file will usually NOT have the same  number  as  the
          corresponding line in the input file.  This can be a problem  when
          tracking down error messages produced by the assembler,  since the
          line numbers displayed do not correspond  to  the  original  input
          file.  To overcome this problem when  using  the  DDS  XASM  cross
          assemblers, MACRO has a command line -L option, which causes it to
          generate  "LINE"  directives whenever it determines that the input
          and output line numbers could be out  of  sync.  These  directives
          will reset the assemblers line counter to match the lines  of  the
          original source file.

    4. APPENDICES

       4.1 Object file formats

             Object files are produced by the assemblers in  either  of  two
          standard formats,  both of which represent the binary data as  two
          digit printable ASCII hex numbers.  The exact contents of the  two
          standard format object files is as follows:

    4.1.1 Motorola hex format

    Data Record: 'Stnnaaaadddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd...cc'
          Where:  S = 'S', indicates start of data record
                  t = Record type, '1'=data, '9'=end of file.
                  n = Count of number of bytes in record.   (in ASCII/HEX)
                  a = Load address of data record.          (in ASCII/HEX)
                  d = Actual data bytes in record.          (in ASCII/HEX)
                  c = Checksum of count, address, and data. (in ASCII/HEX)

                Note1: Checksum is computed as one's complement of eight
                       bit sum of all values from 'nn' to end of data.

                Note2: Count 'nn' is three greater then the number of data
                       bytes in the record.

    4.1.2 Intel hex format

    Data Record: ':nnaaaattdddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd...cc'
          Where:  : = Indicates start of data record
                  n = Count of number of bytes in record.   (in ASCII/HEX)
                  a = Load address of data record.          (in ASCII/HEX)
                  t = Record type                (00=Data, 01=End of file)
                  d = Actual data bytes in record           (in ASCII/HEX)
                  c = Checksum of count, address, and data. (in ASCII/HEX)

                Note1: Checksum is computed as two's complement of eight
                       bit sum of all values from 'nn' to end of data.

                Note2: End of file record contains count of 00.
