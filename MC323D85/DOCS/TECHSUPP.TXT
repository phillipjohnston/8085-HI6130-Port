!!! NOTE !!! - As of early 2010, Dunfield Development Services has begun
making it's products available free of charge - there is *NO* technical
support available on free versions of our products.


                       *** Obtaining Technical Support ***

Dunfield Development Systems is a very SMALL company. In most cases, technical
support is provided by (me) Dave Dunfield, one of the owners of the company,
and the author of all of the software products.

At the time this was written, our policy is to provide unlimited technical
support for our licensed products at no charge (within reason).   I will
continue this policy as long as my time and the support load are such that I
am able to do so. You can help me with both (and get better/faster support)
by observing the following guidelines:

1 - READ the manuals first! I've put a lot of effort into them, and they do
    contain the answers to most frequently asked questions. Also, before
    contacting me, check out the examples, any (library) source code provided
    etc. for the information that you seek. If you do discover information to
    be missing, incorrect, or not clear, PLEASE let me know. I revise the
    manuals regularly, and rely on your feedback to improve them.

2 - Visit our web page, and review all the FAQ's and Application Notes.
    Most of the common questions are answered in these documents.

3 - If you purchased the product through a distributor, please contact that
    distributor first. They are familier with the products, and can answer
    many questions.

4 - I cannot provide technical support by telephone (I would get nothing else
    done, and I cannot be available at all times people might call). The ways
    by which I provide support are (in the order of fastest response first):
        Internet EMAIL: Via technical support link on www.dunfield.com
        FAX:            613-256-5821
        MAIL:           115 Manion Heights Cres.
                        RR#2 Carp, Ontario Canada  K0A 1L0

5 - When requesting technical support, please include the following info:
    - Your name
    - Your customer/serial number (on invoice and disk envelope label)
    - Your EMAIL address (if you have one)
    - Your FAX number    (if you have one)
    - Your telephone number
    - The product for which you are requesting support, and the exact VERSION
      of it that you have (see documentation title page).
    - A complete description of the problem, and if possible a SHORT way to
      replicate it. If you are reporting a compiler problem etc., please
      try and reduce the program causing it to a minimum.

6 - Questions will be answered via the same medium in which they were
    received. Ie: Internet email will be replied to via email and FAX
    messages will be replied to via FAX. In particular:
    - MAKE SURE that your "reply to:" field in email messages or return
      FAX number is correct. I don't have time to track you down!
    - DO NOT send messages asking me to call you, they will be ignored.
      Since I do not charge for tech support, and do not provide for such
      extra charges in my pricing, I cannot do tech support at my expense.

7 - Send problem descriptions and short code samples as ASCII text in the body
    of mail messages, with all lines less than 80 characters. HTML documents,
    attached files, word processor files (any non-ASCII format), and files
    which appear as single **long** lines (this is what Microsoft software
    generates if you do not manually end your lines), will not be accepted.

8 - It should be obvious from the above, but DO NOT SEND ME HTML EMAIL. If
    you are using a "windows" mailer, find the option to send HTML in your
    outgoing email and TURN IT OFF! (All windows related mailers seem to
    default to sending HTML even though this is bad net manners). I reject
    TONS of unreadable mail because it arrives encoded in HTML.

9 - Send email only as ASCII TEXT ... I also reject TONS of unreadable mail
    because it arrives in a "windows" character set that I cannot read.

10- Code samples of more than 10 lines must be sent via email. I cannot take
    the time to type in pages of code from a FAX. If you want to send me
    files in encoded mail messages, use my MAE encoder program (found in the
    EMBEDRAW.ZIP archive of our DEMO/SUPPORT disk). I do not maintain current
    versions of other mail encoders. Also, please do not send me HUGE files
    or collections of files unless I specifically ask for them. Unless I am
    expecting them, my mailer will automatically delete them.

11- Collections of files (which I have asked for) must be sent as a single
    archive (.ZIP or .MAE). DO NOT send email with many separate attached
    files!

12- DO NOT PLACE *ANY* OF OUR DUNFIELD.COM EMAIL ADDRESSES IN YOUR EMAIL
    ADDRESS BOOK! Email address books are harvested by trojans and viruses,
    and we receive a huge amount of "virus" email. DO NOT POST OUT EMAIL
    ADDRESSES IN INTERNET NEWSGROUPS (same reason). Technical support will
    NOT be provided to customers who violate these rules.

NOTE: Technical support is NOT available for demonstration versions of our
products. You must have a valid customer/serial number to obtain technical
support.
